PROMPT="Please create Anki cards based on the provided image. The image contains lecture content that will be asked in the exam, so ensure that you do not miss any important information. Your goal is to help me master the subject through spaced repetition. But first, identify the most essential concepts in the image and then generate modular Anki cards that promote long-term understanding. The cards should be clear, concise, and self-contained. If helpful, include relevant examples or explanations on the back of the card. Be careful about not missing important information."
